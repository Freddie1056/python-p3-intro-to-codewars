# Intro to Codewars

## Learning Goals

- Create an account on Codewars.
- Use your Python skills to solve problems on an online platform.

***

## Key Vocab

- **Kata**: a problem on Codewars to be solved using Python or one of many
  other languages.
- **Kyu/Dan**: the difficulty rankings of problems on Codewars. They range from
  8 kyu to 4 dan.

## Introduction

Now that you know the basics of Python programming, it's time to put in some
practice. In the previous optional module, you may have completed some labs on
concepts such as data structures, conditionals, and loops. These labs help you
get used to your IDE and virtual environment on top of practicing your Python
skills, but forking, cloning, opening apps, coding, and pushing up your work
takes up some time.

Codewars is one of many online tools that allow you to complete lab-like
problems on the go. Codewars calls its problems **katas** and breaks them down
by difficulty: **kyu** (for lower difficulty problems) range from 8 (lowest) to
1 (highest), where **dan** range from 1 to 4. Answering more complex problems
raises your rank, which follows the same kyu/dan system.

For now, we're not using Codewars in pursuit of rank. You're still brand new to
Python, after all! We're going to focus instead on completing a selection of 8-
and 7-kyu problems to make sure that you've internalized the lessons so far.

## Creating a Codewars Account

Open your browser and go to [codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/). You'll see two options
in the top right: "Log in" and "Join". Unless you've already set up an account,
click "Join".

You have two options for logging in: you can link your GitHub account, or you
can create a username and password, connected to your email. If you choose to
go the username/password route, enter your information and click "Enlist" below.

## Navigating Codewars

Once you've registered and logged in, you can get started on solving kata. On
the homepage, Codewars will recommend a problem for you to solve that will help
you level up- your next challenge. This section will also provide the name of
the challenge kata, its difficulty, and a brief description:

![Codewars "Your Next Challenge" section. Provides the name of the next kata,
its difficulty, and a brief description.](
https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/python/next_challenge.png "your
next challenge")

You can choose to move forward using challenges or not. If you would rather
choose from all katas or search individual katas, you can navigate to "Practice"
in the left-side menu:

![Codewars side menu. Contains "Home" at the top, then "Practice" and "Freestyle
Sparring" in the training section underneath.](
https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/python/codewars_side_menu.png
"side menu")

Each kata has a URL as well- in this module, we've shared the URLs for a number
of katas that address Python fundamentals. Don't worry though- as long as you're
signed in, these will still help you increase your rank!

### Solving Katas

Click on a kata and you'll see its full description:

![Full description of a kata called "parseInt() reloaded". Provides a basic
summary, examples, and other important information.](
https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/python/full_kata_description.png
"full kata description")

In the top right corner, you'll see a couple of buttons: "Train" and
"Next Kata". Click on "Train" to give your kata a shot (ideally one a bit
easier than "parseInt() reloaded").

![Two buttons: "Train" and "Next Kata".](

"train next kata")

Next, you should see your instructions on the left and the solution and testing
areas on the right. You will write your solutions in the "Solution" box, and it
will be tested against the cases in the "Sample Tests" box below when you click
on "Test". When all tests are passing, you can click "Submit". This will run
your solution against many (often hundreds) invisible tests to see if your
solution is valid for all input. Once you have passed all of these tests, you
can submit your code and view other users' answers.

![The right side of a kata page. Contains two boxes: "Solution" on top and
"Sample Tests" on the bottom.](
https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/python/codewars_solution_area.png
"kata solution tests")

You'll notice a couple of other things on this page as well. There are two
dropdown menus above the solution box for the programming language and version.
We're using Python version 3.8 to match the rest of the Phase 3 curriculum.
Additionally, you can choose to use a Vim or Emacs interface if you prefer to
navigate the page in different ways. There is also the option to make the
solution window fullscreen if you need more space to work with.

### Continuing Your Practice

After you've completed the katas in this module (or you feel you're ready to
move on to more 7- and 6-kyu katas), remember to come back regularly and
explore the features mentioned above. "Your Next Challenge" is always tailored
to you, but the practice page will provide you the kyu/dan difficulty of every
kata as well:

![A list of Codewars katas with names, difficulties, and available languages
listed.](
https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/python/codewars_practice_page.png
"codewars practice page")

You'll notice here that some katas have many symbols to their right- these
represent the coding languages that you can use to solve them! Codewars isn't
just a Python tool- you can use it to help you when you're learning Haskell or
Go later on as well.

## Conclusion

Codewars is a helpful tool in learning how to use programming languages to
accomplish (usually) simple tasks. We have provided a number of recommended
practice problems in this module- when you have the time, we encourage you to
give them a shot!
