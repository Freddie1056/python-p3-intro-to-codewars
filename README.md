# Intro to Codewars

## Learning Goals

- Create an account on Codewars.
- Use your Python skills to solve problems on an online platform.

***

## Key Vocab

- **Kata**: a problem on Codewars to be solved using Python or one of many
  other languages.
- **Kyu/Dan**: the difficulty rankings of problems on Codewars. They range from
  8 kyu to 4 dan.

## Introduction

Now that you know the basics of Python programming, it's time to put in some
practice. In the previous optional module, you may have completed some labs on
concepts such as data structures, conditionals, and loops. These labs help you
get used to your IDE and virtual environment on top of practicing your Python
skills, but forking, cloning, opening apps, coding, and pushing up your work
takes up some time.

Codewars is one of many online tools that allow you to complete lab-like
problems on the go. Codewars calls its problems **katas** and breaks them down
by difficulty: **kyu** (for lower difficulty problems) range from 8 (lowest) to
1 (highest), where **dan** range from 1 to 4. Answering more complex problems
raises your rank, which follows the same kyu/dan system.

For now, we're not using Codewars in pursuit of rank. You're still brand new to
Python, after all! We're going to focus instead on completing a selection of 8-
and 7-kyu problems to make sure that you've internalized the lessons so far.

## Creating a Codewars Account

Open your browser and go to [codewars.com](codewars.com). You'll see two options
in the top right: "Log in" and "Join". Unless you've already set up an account,
click "Join".

You have two options for logging in: you can link your GitHub account, or you
can create a username and password, connected to your email. If you choose to
go the username/password route, enter your information and click "Enlist" below.

## Conclusion

CLIs are a helpful tool for managing the data on your computer and on remote
servers. A well-built CLI will allow you to let non-technical users complete
many of the same tasks with your application that you can from the Python shell
without very much training at all. Consider the best practices for building CLIs
as you work through the Phase 3 project this week- make sure to look back at
the earlier modules, too!
